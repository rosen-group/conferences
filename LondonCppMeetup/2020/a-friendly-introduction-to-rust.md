## Abstract

Rust's design philosophy aims for a language which helps the developer as much as possible with memory safety, freedom from data races, great error messages and package management. But also no sacrifices shall be made in terms of performance and low-level control over memory.

In this talk, I will introduce Rust and its core principles from the perspective of a C++ developer. Similarities and differences between C++ and Rust will be discussed by comparing the example code in both languages.
