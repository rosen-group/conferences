WebAssembly - Running C++ and Rust in a Web Browser
===================================================

WebAssembly is an open standard for bytecode which is intended to run inside a browser. It is intended as in addition to and not as a replacement for JavaScript with the purpose of enabling high performance applications on the web. Any programming language which  is supported by LLVM (e.g. C++ and Rust) can be compiled to WebAssembly.
This talk shows what WebAssembly is and how to build WebAssembly applications in C++ and Rust.
