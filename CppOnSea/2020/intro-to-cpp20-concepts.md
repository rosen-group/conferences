## Abstract

One of the biggest new features of C++20 are concepts. Concepts define requirements on template arguments which are enforced by the compiler. This leads to more readable code which clearly expresses intent. Error messages are improved since violations of the constraints defined by concepts can be detected in the early stages of the template instantiation.

This talked is aimed at people with little or no experience with concepts and will introduce generic programming with concepts (constraining templates, writing your own concepts and overloading functions which are constrained by concepts).
